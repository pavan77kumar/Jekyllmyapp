            <p class="mb-5"> As a top national mortgage lender, PennyMac Loan Services, LLC (“PennyMac”) is committed to providing its customers with a range of innovative mortgage solutions. Whether they’re new to the home loan process or experienced buyers specifically seeking a competitive <a href="/conventional-home-loans">conventional</a>, <a href="/fha-home-loans">FHA</a>, <a href="/va-home-loans">VA</a>, <a href="/investment-property-loans">investment property</a> or <a href="/jumbo-home-loans">Jumbo loan</a>, PennyMac is dedicated to offering competitive rates and superior service. </p>

               <div class="m-3">
                  <p> Being a direct mortgage lender means PennyMac can focus on the needs of its customers rather than maintaining a network of branches and banking products. The company’s licensed loan officers are trained to help customers through the process every step of the way. </p>
                  <p> Since its founding in 2008, PennyMac has sought to restore Americans’ trust in homeownership by improving the quality and consistency of the mortgage lending experience. </p>
                  <p> The company offers multiple options to help prospective customers buy, refinance or simply stay in their homes. PennyMac has participated in the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) and the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP), federal programs created in 2009 to help customers in need of financial assistance remain in their homes. PennyMac also buys loans from banks and other lenders, using its expertise to help customers restructure their mortgages so they can stay in their homes. As a major loan servicer, the company also supports more than 1,000,000 PennyMac home loan customers. </p>
