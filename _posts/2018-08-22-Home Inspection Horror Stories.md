Many of us have heard scary stories about new homeowners dealing with costly and even dangerous home repairs that they did not expect. From leaky septic tanks and radon gas, to moldy walls and things that freeze in the night, here are our home inspection horror stories, and how to avoid them.


The Wet, the Bad, and the Moldy: Home Inspection Horror Stories
A home that looks great initially can be hiding untold horrors under the surface. From plumbing problems to failing furnaces, there is a lot that can go wrong that might go unnoticed at first glance. Keller Williams’ Richard Powell has seen his share of both fantastic and frightening home inspection findings.

My worst home inspection horror story was back in late 2010; we had a couple who wanted something eclectic had been looking at homes for a few months at this point. We found a home that they fell in love with, wrote the offer, and got into escrow right before Thanksgiving. We scheduled the inspection for the morning of Black Friday (which turned out to be an ironically accurate label for the day) and I met the inspector at about 10am at the property.

In California, most agents perform a visual inspection and complete a form that records their observations. The inspector we used at the time had done about 30 inspections for us at this point and we had a good rapport during these inspections. He started in the attic and after about 20 minutes called down from the second floor and says, “Richard, I don’t think you want your clients buying this home.” He has never said anything like that before, but I had trusted him to make the right call and show me why he thought so.

He started by pointing out the hardwood floors on the second level were cupping (curling up at the sides of each plank). He said he noticed that the plumbing was black ABS pipe that was notorious for leaking. He also noted the furnace had been recalled due to the firebox welds failing and allowing flames to escape out into the attic.

He also suggested that I grab a screwdriver and pull the wall plate for the TV cable and look to see what kind of condition the drywall was in; I did that and when we shined a flashlight into the wall cavity, it was shiny inside. It was so wet you could push a screwdriver through the drywall with almost no effort.

Needless to say, I agreed with his conclusion, we stopped the inspection and I went to call my clients who were driving up from San Diego where they had spent Thanksgiving with family. They were, of course, devastated by the news. The home truly checked off a lot of the boxes they wanted and they didn’t want to cancel.

I got the Home Inspector on speaker phone and we walked them through estimates of what it would cost to repair the damage, remediate the mold, and replace the HVAC and plumbing. Needless to say, even before they saw how bad it was, they agreed to cancel the escrow. Not the holiday weekend any of us were anticipating, but we definitely kept them from buying a money pit that would have driven them into bankruptcy.

Environmental testing expert, Robert Weitz is a microbial investigator and principal at RTK Environmental Group, a leader in the industry of testing for mold, lead, asbestos, VOCs, water, soil, radon, and overall indoor air quality. He helps homeowners and commercial property owners by assessing environmental conditions, identifying the causes of any issues, and explaining the best ways to fix any problems. He was able to use his knowledge and tools to save potential home buyers from a truly scary situation.

I had one situation that didn’t turn into a horror story because we went in and did mold testing. A couple was looking to purchase a home that had been renovated by a builder. It looked pristine, but had a musty smell. When the mold tests came back, the mold spore count was through the roof.

What they didn’t know is that the builder had let time elapse during the renovation, and rain soaked through all three floors of the house, causing a mold infestation. The builder fixed up the problems visually and repainted to make it look like nothing had happened, when in reality the whole house was covered in mold. The couple walked away from the sale and is lucky they did. It cost the builder over $100,000 to gut and replace the mold-damaged materials. Had they not opted for an environmental inspection, they would have had that bill in their lap after purchase.
