Federal Reserve and Mortgages
The Federal Reserve & You: Questions and Answers

Perhaps you read the headlines -- in September, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate to 2.25%, the third bump in 2018. Raising rates have been part of “The Fed’s” strategy since 2015, after nearly seven years where rates were near zero.

But even after reading the headlines, you may wonder, “How does this affect me?” It’s a good question, and here are some answers.

What is the Federal Reserve?
The Federal Reserve System is the United States’ central bank. The system regulates banks, credit unions and other financial institutions, while setting monetary policy that helps maintain a stable U.S. economy. A seven-member “board of governors” is appointed by the president to oversee this work, and also set the benchmark interest rate.

What is a benchmark interest rate?
This is the rate that financial institutions, such as banks, use to determine interest rates for lending to each other. Banks and institutions lend to each other to maintain “mandated reserve levels,” or the minimum each institution needs to be solvent.

The benchmark interest rate is also called the federal funds rate, or base interest rate. When this rate increases, it becomes more expensive for banks to borrow from each other. “The federal rate changes affect the short-term borrowing rate,” says Sherman Clayton, vice president of margin management at PennyMac Loan Services, LLC.

Why does the Federal Reserve change interest rates?
The rate is used like a gas pedal. To accelerate the economy, rates were at zero percent for years, after the Great Recession, making money easy and efficient to borrow.

The brake is applied and rates are upped when the Federal Reserve becomes concerned about an “overheating” economy, where prices and wages are rising fast. When money becomes more expensive to borrow, it slows the amount being borrowed, lent and spent – but people save more.

The reserve considers economic forecasts that include inflation, unemployment, economic growth and other factors, before deciding to change the rate.

How does the Federal Reserve’s rate change affect my current mortgage?
If you already have a fixed-rate mortgage, your rate stays the same for the life of your loan, whether 15 years or 30.

If you’re shopping for a mortgage, rates offered go up and down due to many factors. They can be influenced by Federal Reserve policy, including the federal funds rate and buying and selling government bonds, which can be complicated to understand – but you can read more here.

The Fed’s rate increases don’t cause mortgage rates to climb immediately – but do have a broad impact on the economy, which eventually leads to a rise over time.

Does the Federal Interest Rate affect my HELOC, ARM or other variable-rate mortgage?
Where variable-rate loans are concerned, “there’s a direct correlation to the benchmarked rate,” Clayton says.
